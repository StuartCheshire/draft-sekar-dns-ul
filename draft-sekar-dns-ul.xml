    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes a method of extending Dynamic DNS Update to
      contain an update lease lifetime, allowing a server to garbage collect stale
      resource records.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Dynamic DNS Update <xref target="RFC2136"/> allows for a mapping from a persistent
      hostname to a dynamic IP address. This capability is particularly
      beneficial to mobile hosts, whose IP address may frequently change
      with location. However, the mobile nature of such hosts often means
      that dynamically updated resource records are not properly
      deleted. Consider, for instance, a mobile user who publishes address
      records via dynamic update. If this user moves
      their laptop out of range of the Wi-Fi access point,
      the address record containing stale information
      may remain on the server indefinitely.
      An extension to Dynamic Update is
      thus required to tell the server to automatically delete resource
      records if they are not refreshed after a period of time.</t>

      <t>Note that overloading the resource record TTL <xref target="RFC1035"/> is not
      appropriate for purposes of garbage collection. Data that is
      susceptible to frequent change or invalidation, thus requiring a
      garbage collection mechanism, needs a relatively short resource
      record TTL to avoid polluting intermediate DNS caches with stale
      data. Using this TTL, short enough to minimize stale cached data,
      as a garbage collection lease lifetime would result in an unacceptable
      amount of network traffic due to refreshes
      (see <xref target="refresh"/> "Refresh Messages").</t>

    <section title="Mechanisms">
      <t>Dynamic DNS Update Leases is implemented using the standard Dynamic
      Update message format <xref target="RFC2136"/> in conjunction with an EDNS(0) OPT
      pseudo-RR <xref target="RFC2671"/> with a new OPT and RDATA format proposed here. 
      Encoding the Update Lease Lifetime in an OPT RR requires minimal
      modification to a name server's front-end, and will cause servers
      that do not implement this extension to automatically return a
      descriptive error (NOTIMPL).</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Update Message Format" anchor="update">
      <t>
      Dynamic DNS Update Leases Requests and Responses are formatted as standard DNS Dynamic Update messages
      <xref target="RFC2136"/>, with the addition of a single OPT RR
      in the Additional section.
      Note that if a TSIG resource record is
      to be added to authenticate the update <xref target="RFC2845"/>, the TSIG RR should
      appear *after* the OPT RR, allowing the message digest in the TSIG to
      cover the OPT RR.</t>

      <t>The OPT RR is formatted as follows:</t>

<figure align="center" anchor="lease_opt" suppress-title="true"><artwork align="center"><![CDATA[
Field Name      Field Type    Description
----------------------------------------------------------------
NAME            domain name   empty (root domain)
TYPE            u_int16_t     OPT
CLASS           u_int16_t     0

                              granted lease (response), in seconds
KEY-LEASE        u_int32_t    optional desired (or granted) lease
                              
]]></artwork></figure>

      <t>Update Requests contain, in the LEASE field of the OPT RDATA, an
      unsigned 32-bit integer indicating the lease lifetime, in seconds, desired
      by the client, represented in network (big-endian) byte order.
      In Update Responses, this field contains the actual
      lease granted by the server. The lease granted by the
      server may be less than, greater than, or equal to the value
      requested by the client. To reduce network and server load, a
      minimum lease of 30 minutes (1800 seconds) is RECOMMENDED.
      Leases are expected to be sufficiently long as to make timer
      discrepancies (due to transmission latency, etc.) between a client
      and server negligible. Clients that expect the updated records to be
      relatively static MAY request appropriately longer leases. Servers
      MAY grant relatively longer or shorter leases to reduce network
      traffic due to refreshes, or reduce stale data, respectively.</t>

      <t>There are two variants of the EDNS(0) UPDATE-LEASE option,
      the basic (4-byte) variant and the extended (8-byte) variant.</t>

      <t>In the basic (4-byte) variant, the LEASE indicated in the
      OPT RR applies to all resource records in the Update section.</t>

      <t>In the extended (8-byte) variant, the Update Lease communicates two lease lifetimes.
      The LEASE indicated in the
      OPT RR applies to all resource records in the Update section *except* for KEY records.
      The KEY-LEASE indicated in the
      OPT RR applies to KEY records in the Update section.
      This variant is used specifically for supporting the DNS-SD
      Service Registration Protocol <xref target="I-D.sctl-service-registration"/>.
      </t>
   
    </section>

    <section title="Refresh Messages" anchor="refresh">
      <t>Resource records not to be deleted by the server MUST be refreshed by
      the client before the lease elapses. Clients SHOULD refresh resource
      records after 75% of the original lease has elapsed. If the client
      uses UDP and does not receive a response from the server, the client
      SHOULD re-try after 2 seconds. The client SHOULD continue to re-try,
      doubling the length of time between each re-try, or re-try using TCP.</t>

      <section title="Coalescing Refresh Messages">
        <t>If the client has sent multiple updates to a single server, the
        client MAY include refreshes for all valid updates to that server in
        a single message. This effectively places all records for a client
        on the same expiration schedule, reducing network traffic due to
        refreshes. In doing so, the client includes in the refresh message
        all existing updates to the server, including those not yet close to
        expiration, so long as at least one resource record in the message
        has elapsed at least 75% of its original lease. If the client uses
        UDP, the client MUST NOT coalesce refresh messages if doing so would
        cause truncation of the message; in this case, multiple messages or
        TCP should be used.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Refresh Message Format">
        <t>Refresh messages are formatted like Dynamic Update Leases Requests
        and Responses (see <xref target="update"/> "Update Message Format"). The resource
        records to be refreshed are contained in the Update section. These
        same resource records are repeated in the Prerequisite section, as
        an "RRSet exists (value dependent)" prerequisite <xref target="RFC2136"/>.
        An OPT RR is the last resource record in the Additional
        section (except for a TSIG record, which, if required, follows the
        OPT RR). The OPT RR contains the desired new lease on Requests, and
        the actual granted lease on Responses. The Update Lease indicated in
        the OPT RR applies to all resource records in the Update section.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Server Behavior">
        <t>Upon receiving a valid Refresh Request, the server MUST send an
        acknowledgment. This acknowledgment is identical to the Update
        Response format described in <xref target="update"/> "Update Message Format",
        and contains the new lease of the resource records being refreshed.
        If no records in the Refresh Request have completed 50% of their
        leases, the server SHOULD NOT refresh the records; the response
        should contain the smallest remaining (unrefreshed) lease of all
        records in the refresh message. The server MUST NOT increment the
        SOA serial number of a zone as the result of a refresh.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Garbage Collection">
      <t>If the Update Lease of a resource record elapses without being
      refreshed, the server MUST NOT return the expired record in answers
      to queries. The server MAY delete the record from its database.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>The EDNS(0) OPTION CODE 2 has already been assigned for this DNS
      extension. No additional IANA services are required by this document.</t>
